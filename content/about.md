## Abstract

Careful transfer of ions into the gas-phase permits the measurement of protein structures, with ion mobility-mass
spectrometry, which provides shape and stoichiometry information. Collision cross sections (CCS) can be obtained
from measurements made of the proteins mobility through a given gas, and such structural information once
obtained should also permit inter-lab comparisons. However, until recently there was not a recommended standard
form for the reporting of such measurements. In this study we explore the use of collision cross section distributions
to allow comparability of IM-MS data for proteins on different instruments. We present measurements on seven
standard proteins across three IM-MS configurations, namely an Agilent 6560 IM QToF, a Waters Synapt G2
possessing a TWIMS cell and a modified Synapt G2 possessing an RF confining linear field drift cell. Mobility
measurements were taken using both He and N2 as the drift gases. To aid comparability across instruments and best
assess the corresponding gas-phase conformational landscapes of the protein ‘standards’ we present the data in the
form of averaged collision cross section distributions. For experiments carried out in N2, CCS values for the most
compact ion conformations have an inter-instrument variability of ≤ 3%, and the total CCS distributions are similar
across platforms. For experiments carried out in He, we observe the total CCS distributions to follow the same trend
as observed in N2, whilst CCS for the most compact ion conformations sampled on the 6560, are systematically
smaller by up to 10%, than those observed on the G2. From this study, we observe the applied protein calibration
procedure (for TWIMS) to yield TWCCS for native-like proteins which are largely similar to those obtained on DTIMS
instruments. However, when considering the ease by which unintentional protein structural activation in vacuo can
occur and the broad range of DTCCS within the literature from which to calibrate drift times against, we advise
caution when calibrating sample protein drift times against protein ‘standards’ in order to obtain CCS values and
recommend the use of CCS distributions.
